# SimpleDragonCurve
A simple implementation of the [Dragon Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_curve) fractal, in Java, that spits out a picture once complete.

Again, the implementation was very simple - I just followed the [Lidenmayer system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system) rules that were laid out on the Wikipedia article. Since they're basically recursive algorithms, it was a very easy coding project. Took me all of one evening, I think.
